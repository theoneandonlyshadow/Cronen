- Added: Integrated Dataset on Systems, Security, and Computing (Yes, uncensored)

# Warning

<b>This dataset is absolutely disgusting. Seriously, its the bottom of the barrel.</b>
Inside you’ll find:

- Slurs, insults, and all the charming ways people dehumanize others

- Graphic descriptions and “how-to”s on genocide, because apparently someone thought that was a good idea

- Hate speech, violence, and enough toxicity to melt a server rack

If youre using this, congrats youre officially responsible for every single thing you do with it. No passing the buck. No “oops.” This isn’t a toy, a meme, or something to show off. It’s here for research, analysis, or containment. Nothing else.

We are not your lawyer, your babysitter, or your PR team. Use it wrong, and that’s on you. Don’t say we didn’t warn you lol.
